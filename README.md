One dataset is titled train.csv and the other is titled test.csv.

Train.csv contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. We need to predict this outcome for each passenger.

Using the patterns in the train.csv data, we need to predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived or not.
